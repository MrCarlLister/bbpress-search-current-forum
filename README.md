# bbpress-search-current-forum
Search the current and sub forums / topics only

Created this using http://sevenspark.com/tutorials/how-to-search-a-single-forum-with-bbpress which searches current forum. Extended functionality to include all sub forums (and topics) too.

Does not effect "all forum" search at top level.

Please send pull requests, if I get time I will make into plugin.
